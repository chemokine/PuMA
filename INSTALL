Minimum Requirements for compile
================================

 To compile the PuMA software on a Linux/Unix machine you must have the following:

 *Required Hardware and Software Packages:
   o The machine must be on a 64-bit operating system.
   o The machine needs over 16G of memory per PuMA job.
   o Perl 5 
   o xvfb-run (part of X11)
   o Cutadapt (https://cutadapt.readthedocs.org/en/stable)
   o Bowtie2 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio)
   o Diamond (https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond)
   o MEGAN (http://ab.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/software/megan5)


 *Required Perl Modules:
   o FindBin
   o Cwd
   o Carp
   o Getopt::Std
   o File::Copy
   o File::Basename
   o Benchmark
   o Config::Tiny

 *Optional Software Packages Used:


BASIC Installation from sources
===============================
 Basic installation will build the paths and configurations directory located in the top level PuMA folder.
 Installation will generate an example.conf file that will be stored under the "conf" directory.

 o Linux / Solaris / Mac OSX: To compile the PuMA you simply need to type:
   	
	$ tar xzvf PuMA_<version>.<revision>.tar.gz
	$ cd PuMA_<version>.<revision>
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	
	Now you will need to edit the example configuration file located under the PuMA conf directory and 
	add the information about databases and other files needed. These options can be included when doing
	the Full Installation below. 

    o Example:
	$ tar xzvf PuMA_1.1.tar.gz
	$ cd PuMA_1.1
	$ ./configure
	$ make



Full Installation from sources
===============================
 Full installation will build the paths and configurations directory located in the top level PuMA folder.
 Installation will generate an example.conf file that will be stored under the "conf" directory.

 o Linux / Solaris / Mac OSX: To compile the PuMA you simply need to type:
   	
	$ tar xzvf PuMA_<version>.<revision>.tar.gz
	$ cd PuMA_<version>.<revision>
	$ ./configure --with-bowtie2db=<bowtie2 db path> --with-diamonddb=<diamond db path> --with-meganlicense=<megan license file> --with-taxGIFile=<path to taxGI file> --with-seedGIFile=<path to seedGI file> --with-keggGIFile=<path to keggGI file>
	$ make

    o Example:
	$ tar xzvf PuMA_1.1.tar.gz
	$ cd PuMA_1.1
	$ ./configure --with-bowtie2db=/data/db/hg19.bt2 --with-diamonddb=/data/db/diamond.dmnd --with-meganlicense=/data/megan/MEGAN5-academic-license.txt --with-taxGIFile=/data/db/gi_taxid.bin --with-seedGIFile=/data/db/gi_seed.bin --with-keggGIFile=/data/db/gi_kegg.bin
	$ make
